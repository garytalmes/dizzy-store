# Dizzy Store 

This is a small Node-based app I put together to help illustrate OOP and how you can build applications with it.

I've deliberately left the Order Summary part of the app unfinished for any student who feels like trying it.

## Instructions

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `node index.js` to start the app.

## Caveat

You are welcome to use this code as a means of learning, but none of this code may be copied/pasted into any class assignment. Learn from the code but do your own work.
